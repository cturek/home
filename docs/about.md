## About Me

Hi! I'm Cedar. Currently, I'm a senior at Harvey Mudd College majoring in math and engineering.

## Work Experience

I'm currently doing research with Professor David Harris as a Clay-Wolkin fellow. 

## Classes

I've taken and tutored a lot of classes. Check out the list [here](https://cturek.github.io/home/Classes.html).

## System Block Diagram

The high level block diagram is shown below:

The FPGA interfaces with an LED display, a keypad, and a motor. The MCU interfaces with a liquid crystal display (LCD) and a radio-frequency identification (RFID) reader. The FPGA and MCU are connected to tie the two systems together. 

In the figure below, the top breadboard connects the MCU (white) with the LCD and the RFID reader (floating, black). The bottom breadboard connects the FPGA (blue), the keypad, the LED display, and the motor (under the autofeeder housing).
