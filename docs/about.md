## About Me

Hi! I'm Cedar. Currently, I'm a senior at Harvey Mudd College majoring in math and engineering.

## Work Experience

I'm currently doing research with Professor David Harris as a Clay-Wolkin fellow. We are designing and writing a textbook for a RISC-V pipelined processor. I'm coauthoring a paper on the division and square root module (links coming soon).

I also [grade and tutor for various classes](https://cturek.github.io/home/classes.html).

In the past, I worked as an intern at [Volpe Pathways](https://www.volpe.dot.gov/about-us/careers/student-and-recent-graduate-opportunities), as a counselor at [MathPath](https://www.mathpath.org/), and as a [backgammon researcher under Professor Arthur Benjamin](https://www.hmc.edu/about/2021/01/11/art-benjamin-is-backgammon-champ/).

## Projects

Here are some projects I've worked on.

[Pet Autofeeder](https://cturek.github.io/Autofeeder.html)

Physical Chess Puzzle (link coming soon!)

Magnet Maze (link coming soon!)

## Classes

I've taken and tutored a lot of classes. Check out the list [here](https://cturek.github.io/home/classes.html).

For my senior major capstones, I am writing a [math thesis](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/cturek) on differential topology and doing an engineering clinic with [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/) measuring ferroelectric permittivity of barium titanate.
