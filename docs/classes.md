# Engr 154: System-on-Chip Design

**I helped write the textbook for this class.**

System-on-chip design of a RISC-V based platform. Topics include RISC-V architecture, C and assembly language programming and debugging, platform emulation, Linux-based workflow automation, SystemVerilog, logic synthesis and validation, pipelined microarchitecture, privileged operations, bus interfaces and peripherals, memory systems, branch prediction, computer arithmetic, benchmarking, operating systems, and silicon implementation. Class project involving design and optimization.

Taught by Professor David Harris, SP23.

# Engr 80: Experimental Engineering

A laboratory course designed to acquaint the student with the basic techniques of instrumentation and measurement in both the laboratory and in engineering field measurements. Emphasis on experimental problem solving in real systems.

Taught by Staff, SP23.

# Math 104: Graph Theory

An introduction to graph theory with applications. Theory and applications of trees, matchings, graph coloring, planarity, graph algorithms, and other topics.

Taught by Professor Mohamed Omar, SP23.

# Math 189AA: Commutative Algebra

This course is an introduction to the fundamental concepts and questions in the study of commutative rings, with a special focus on the notion of "prime ideals," and how they generalize the idea primeness in the integers. Possible topics include Noetherian rings, primary decomposition, basic module theory, exact sequences and key results like the Krull Altitude Theorem and Nakayama's Lemma.

Taught by Professor Haydee Lindo, FA22.

# Engr 85: Digital Design and Computer Architecture

Design and implementation of digital systems. Topics include levels of abstraction, Boolean algebra, combinational logic, sequential logic, finite state machines, hardware description languages, computer arithmetic, C and assembly programming, embedded systems, and microarchitecture. Lab practices include simulation, prototyping, and debugging

Taught by Professor David Harris, FA22. 

# Math 171: Abstract Algebra

Groups, rings, fields and additional topics. Topics in group theory include groups, subgroups, quotient groups, Lagrange's theorem, symmetry groups, and the isomorphism theorems. Topics in Ring theory include Euclidean domains, PIDs, UFDs, fields, polynomial rings, ideal theory, and the isomorphism theorems. In recent years, additional topics have included the Sylow theorems, group actions, modules, representations, and introductory category theory.

Taught by Professor Michael Orrison, SP22; Professor Mohamed Omar, FA21 and SP21.

# Math 82: Differential Equations

Modeling physical systems, first-order ordinary differential equations, existence, uniqueness, and long-term behavior of solutions; bifurcations; approximate solutions; second-order ordinary differential equations and their properties, applications; first-order systems of ordinary differential equations. Applications to linear systems of ordinary differential equations, matrix exponential; nonlinear systems of differential equations; equilibrium points and their stability.

Taught by Staff, FA20.

# Math 19: Calculus

A comprehensive view of the theory and techniques of differential and integral calculus of a single variable together with a robust introduction to multivariable calculus. Topics include limits, continuity, derivatives, definite integrals, infinite series, Taylor series in one and several variables, partial derivatives, double and triple integrals, linear approximations, the gradient, directional derivatives and the Jacobian, optimization and the second derivative test, higher-order derivatives and Taylor approximations, line integrals, vector fields, curl, divergence, Green's theorem, and an introduction to flux and surface integrals.

Taught by Staff, FA20.

# Math 73: Linear Algebra

Theory and applications of linearity, including vectors, matrices, systems of linear equations, dot and cross products, determinants, linear transformations in Euclidean space, linear independence, bases, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and diagonalization. General vector spaces and linear transformations; change of basis and similarity.
